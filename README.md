# Browser tests
A few browser tests for quick access from smart TVs.

At the moment it outputs the UA string and checks for WebRTC Encoded Transform / RTCRtpScriptTransform, Managed MSE (iOS/Safari), HDCP and DRM support. Some codec tests are coming in the future, for now it's just a single AV1 playback test (which happens to misbehave on my LG TV)
